  <h6>Hadith for today</h6>
  <span>
    On the authority of Abu hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is better for anyone to earn his living
    by
    carrying a load of fire-wood on his back than begging someone to give him something, for that person may refuse to
    give him anything.”(Bukhari and Muslim)
  </span>
  <h6>Commentary:</h6>
  <span>
    As compared to beggary, this Hadith puts emphasis on hard work. However, people may look down upon manual labour
    or
    hard work, yet it is certainly far better than seeking charity, because doing a job like this will certainly save
    a
    man’s self-respect, whereas begging puts him in an awkward position. To put it in this way, Islam stands for a
    man’s
    deliverance from indignity and teaches him to keep his sense of dignity
